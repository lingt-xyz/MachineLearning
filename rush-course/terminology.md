# Terminology

### Machine Learning

ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

### Labels

A label is the thing we're predicting—the $y$ variable in simple linear regression. The label could be the future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the meaning of an audio clip, or just about anything.

### Features

A feature is an input variable—the$$x$$variable in simple linear regression. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features, specified as:

$$
x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N
$$

### Examples

An example is a particular instance of data.

### Models

A model defines the relationship between features and label. For example, a spam detection model might associate certain features strongly with "spam".

### Regression vs. classification

* A regression model predicts _**continuous**_ values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
  * What is the value of a house in California?
  * What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?
* A classification model predicts _**discrete**_ values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
  * Is a given email message spam or not spam?
  * Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
