## Machine Learning definition

Arthur Samuel \(1959\). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell \(1998\). Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task Tand some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learning

### Regression

Continuous number

### Classification

Output is discrete

## Support Vector machines

Use infinite-dimension vector of features
